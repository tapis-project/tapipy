## 1.5.0 - 2023-12-05
### Added
- No change.

### Changed
- No change.

### Removed
- No change.


## 1.4.1 - 2023-07-03
### Added
- No change.

### Changed
- `from openapi_core import Spec` is now done globally instead of the local scope so threaded processes work.

### Removed
- No change.


## 1.4.0 - 2023-06-12
### Added
- Added new dereferencing function for up to date openapi-spec and jsonschema-spec libraries.

### Changed
- Updated openapi-core to 0.16.0. This changes create_spec to Spec.from_file().
- spec object created is different, less proprietary objects.
- $refs are lazy dereferenced, so there's a dereferencer to output a ready spec that we can pickle.
- Updates to accommodate these changes.
- Found one bug in jsonschema-spec that I created an issue about, fixed it locally. Package author suggested to lock typing-extensions<4.6 which solves the problem for Python==3.7
- To note, openapi-core 0.16.1 and above seem to require flask==2.0
- `from openapi_core import Spec` was moved from top level imports to only when needed as import was decently slow (1.5+ sec).
- Adding `v2-` prefix to pickled files to ensure compatibility. Without this there's a possibility of old specs being read and that causing errors.

### Removed
- Spec are no longer created at initialization, only need to be loaded. 7 seconds -> .04 seconds.

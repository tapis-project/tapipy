    description: |
      The permissions model allows for fine grained access control of resources. The system owner
      may grant READ and MODIFY permission to specific users. MODIFY implies READ.
  
      Please note that Tapis also supports a higher level approach to granting access known as *Sharing*.
  - name: Sharing
    description: |
      In addition to fine grained permissions support, Tapis also supports a higher level approach to granting access.
      This approach is known simply as *sharing*. The sharing API allows you to share a system with a set of users
      as well as share publicly with all users in a tenant. Sharing grants users READ and EXECUTE access to the system.

        Create a system using a request body. System name must be unique within a tenant and can be composed of
        alphanumeric characters and the following special characters [-._~].
        Name must begin with an alphabetic character and can be no more than 80 characters in length.
        Description is optional with a maximum length of 2048 characters.

        If the *effectiveUserId* is static (i.e. not *${apiUserId}*) then credentials may optionally be provided in the
        *authnCredential* attribute of the request body. The Systems service does not store the secrets in its
        database, they are persisted in the Security Kernel.

        By default any credentials provided for LINUX type systems are verified. Use query parameter
        skipCredentialCheck=true to bypass initial verification of credentials.

        Note that certain attributes in the request body (such as tenant) are allowed but ignored so that the JSON
        result returned by a GET may be modified and used when making a POST request to create a system.
        The attributes that are allowed but ignored are

          - tenant

          - deleted

        Update all updatable attributes of a system using a request body identical to POST. System must exist.

        If the *effectiveUserId* is static (i.e. not *${apiUserId}*) then credentials may optionally be provided in the
        *authnCredential* attribute of the request body. The Systems service does not store the secrets in its
        database, they are persisted in the Security Kernel.


        By default any credentials provided for LINUX type systems are verified. Use query parameter
        skipCredentialCheck=true to bypass initial verification of credentials.

        Note that certain attributes in the request body (such as tenant) are allowed but ignored so that the JSON
        result returned by a GET may be modified and used when making a PUT request to update a system.

        The attributes that are allowed but ignored for both PUT and POST are

          - tenant
          - uuid
          - deleted
          - created
          - updated

        In addition for a PUT operation the following non-updatable attributes are allowed but ignored

          - id
          - systemType
          - owner
          - enabled
          - bucketName
          - rootDir
          - isDtn
          - canExec

        Note that the attributes owner and enabled may be modified using other endpoints.

      description: |
        Create or update credentials in the Security Kernel for given system and target *userName* using a request body.
        Requester must be owner of the system. Credentials for multiple authentication methods may be provided.

        The Systems service does not store the secrets in its database, they are persisted in the Security Kernel.

        If the *effectiveUserId* for the system is dynamic (i.e. equal to *${apiUserId}*) then *{userName}* is interpreted
        as a Tapis user and the request body may contain the optional attribute *loginUser* which will be used to map the
        Tapis user to a username to be used when accessing the system. If the login user is not provided then there is
        no mapping and the Tapis user is always used when accessing the system.

        If the *effectiveUserId* for the system is static (i.e. not *${apiUserId}*) then *{userName}* is interpreted
        as the login user to be used when accessing the host.

        Operation is allowed if requester is the system owner or a tenant administrator.
        If the *effectiveUserId* for the system is dynamic (i.e. equal to *${apiUserId}*) then the operation is allowed
        if *{userName}* is the Tapis user making the request.

        Secrets for multiple authentication methods may be provided.

        By default any credentials provided for LINUX type systems are verified. Use query parameter
        *skipCredentialCheck=true* to bypass initial verification of credentials.

        Create a scheduler profile using a request body. Name must be unique within a tenant and can be composed of
        alphanumeric characters and the following special characters [-._~].
        Name must begin with an alphabetic character and can be no more than 80 characters in length.
        Description is optional with a maximum length of 2048 characters.

        Note that certain attributes (such as *tenant*) are allowed but ignored so that the JSON result returned by a GET
        may be modified and used when making a POST request to create a profile.
        The attributes that are allowed but ignored are

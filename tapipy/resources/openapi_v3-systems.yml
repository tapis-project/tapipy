      description: |
        Create a system using a request body. System name must be unique within a tenant and can be composed of
        alphanumeric characters and the following special characters [-._~].
        Name must begin with an alphabetic character and can be no more than 80 characters in length.
        Description is optional with a maximum length of 2048 characters.

        By default any credentials provided for LINUX type systems are verified. Use query parameter
        skipCredentialCheck=true to bypass initial verification of credentials.

        Note that certain attributes (such as tenant) are allowed but ignored so that the JSON result returned by a GET
        may be modified and used when making a POST request to create a system.
        The attributes that are allowed but ignored are

          - tenant

      summary: Update all updatable attributes of a system
      description: |
        Update all updatable attributes of a system using a request body identical to POST. System must exist.

        By default any credentials provided for LINUX type systems are verified. Use query parameter
        skipCredentialCheck=true to bypass initial verification of credentials.

        Note that certain attributes (such as tenant) are allowed but ignored so that the JSON result returned by a GET
        may be modified and used when making a PUT request to update a system.

        The attributes that are allowed but ignored for both PUT and POST are

          - tenant
          - uuid
          - deleted
          - created
          - updated

        In addition for a PUT operation the following non-updatable attributes are allowed but ignored

          - id
          - systemType
          - owner
          - enabled
          - bucketName
          - rootDir
          - isDtn
          - canExec

        Note that the attributes owner and enabled may be modified using other endpoints.

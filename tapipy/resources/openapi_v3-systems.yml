  - name: Permissions
    description: |
      The permissions model allows for fine grained access control of resources. The system owner
      may grant READ and MODIFY permission to specific users. MODIFY implies READ.
      Note that Tapis permissions are independent of native permissions enforced by the underlying
      system host.
  
      Tapis also supports a higher level approach to granting access known as *Sharing*.
  - name: Sharing
    description: |
      In addition to fine grained permissions support, Tapis also supports a higher level approach to granting access.
      This approach is known simply as *sharing*. The sharing API allows you to share a system with a set of users
      as well as share publicly with all users in a tenant. Sharing grants users READ and EXECUTE access to the system.
      When the system has a dynamic *effectiveUserId*, sharing also allows for MODIFY access to all paths for calls
      made through the Files service.
      Note that Tapis permissions and sharing are independent of native permissions enforced by the underlying
      system host.

      description: |
        Create a system using a request body. System name must be unique within a tenant and can be composed of
        alphanumeric characters and the following special characters [-._~].
        Name must begin with an alphanumeric character and can be no more than 80 characters in length.
        Description is optional with a maximum length of 2048 characters.

        The attribute *host* represents a host name, IP address, Globus Endpoint Id or Globus Collection Id.

        The attribute *effectiveUserId* determines the host login user, the user used to access the underlying host.
        The attribute can be set to a static string indicating a specific user (such as a service account) or
        dynamically specified as *${apiUserId}*. For the case of *${apiUserId}*, the service resolves the variable by
        extracting the identity from the request to the service (i.e. the JWT) and applying a mapping to a host login
        user if such a mapping has been provided. If no mapping is provided, then the extracted identity is taken to be
        the host login user.

        If the *effectiveUserId* is static (i.e. not *${apiUserId}*) then credentials may optionally be provided in the
        *authnCredential* attribute of the request body. The Systems service does not store the secrets in its
        database, they are persisted in the Security Kernel.

        By default for LINUX and S3 type systems credentials provided are verified. Use query parameter
        skipCredentialCheck=true to bypass initial verification of credentials.

        The attribute *rootDir* serves as an effective root directory when operating on files through the Tapis
        Files service. When using Files to list, copy, move, mkdir, etc. all paths are relative to this directory.

        Note that certain attributes in the request body (such as tenant) are allowed but ignored so that the JSON
        result returned by a GET may be modified and used when making a POST request to create a system.
        The attributes that are allowed but ignored are

          - tenant

          - deleted

        Update all updatable attributes of a system using a request body identical to POST. System must exist.

        If the *effectiveUserId* is static (i.e. not *${apiUserId}*) then credentials may optionally be provided in the
        *authnCredential* attribute of the request body. The Systems service does not store the secrets in its
        database, they are persisted in the Security Kernel.


        By default for LINUX and S3 type systems credentials provided are verified. Use query parameter
        skipCredentialCheck=true to bypass initial verification of credentials.

        Note that certain attributes in the request body (such as tenant) are allowed but ignored so that the JSON
        result returned by a GET may be modified and used when making a PUT request to update a system.

        The attributes that are allowed but ignored for both PUT and POST are

          - tenant
          - uuid
          - deleted
          - created
          - updated

        In addition for a PUT operation the following non-updatable attributes are allowed but ignored

          - id
          - systemType
          - owner
          - enabled
          - bucketName
          - rootDir
          - isDtn

        Note that the attributes owner and enabled may be modified using other endpoints.

        Credentials for multiple authentication methods may be provided. Note that there is support for only one set of
        credentials per user per system. Updating credentials overwrites previously registered data.

        The Systems service does not store the secrets in its database, they are persisted in the Security Kernel.

        as a Tapis user and the request body may contain the optional attribute *loginUser* which will be used to map the
        Tapis user to a username to be used when accessing the system. If the login user is not provided then there is
        no mapping and the Tapis user is always used when accessing the system.

        If the *effectiveUserId* for the system is static (i.e. not *${apiUserId}*) then *{userName}* is interpreted
        as the login user to be used when accessing the host.

        Operation is allowed if requester is the system owner or a tenant administrator.
        If the *effectiveUserId* for the system is dynamic (i.e. equal to *${apiUserId}*) then the operation is allowed
        if *{userName}* is the Tapis user making the request.

        In Globus the code is referred to as a *Native App Authorization Code*.
        The host property of the system is used as the Globus Endpoint Id or Globus Collection Id.
        Once a user has obtained an authorization code, the corresponding Systems endpoint for generating
        Globus tokens should be called to exchange the code + sessionId for a pair of access and refresh tokens.
        The session Id is a Tapis Id that is used to track the oauth2 flow that is started when this call is made.
        The authorization code, as per Globus documentation, is valid for 10 minutes.

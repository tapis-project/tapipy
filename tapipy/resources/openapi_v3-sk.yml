      description: |-
        Add a permission to an existing role using a request body.  If the permission already exists, then the request has no effect and the change count returned is zero. Otherwise, the permission is added and the change count is one.

        Permissions are case-sensitive strings that follow the format defined by Apache Shiro (https://shiro.apache.org/permissions.html).  This format defines any number of colon-separated (:) parts, with the possible use of asterisks (*) as wildcards and commas (,) as aggregators.  Here are two example permission strings:

            system:MyTenant:read,write:system1
            system:MyTenant:create,read,write,delete:*

        See the Shiro documentation for further details.  Note that the three reserved characters, [: * ,], cannot appear in the text of any part.  It's the application's responsibility to escape those characters in a manner that is safe in the application's domain.

        ### Extended Permissions
        Tapis extends Shiro permission checking with *path semantics*.  Path semantics allows the last part of pre-configured permissions to be treated as hierarchical path names, such as the paths used in POSIX file systems.  Currently, only permissions that start with *files:* have their last (5th) component configured with path semantics.

        Path semantics treat the extended permission part as the root of the subtree to which the permission is applied recursively.  Grantees assigned the permission will have the permission on the path itself and on all its children.

        As an example, consider a role that's assigned the following permission:

            files:iplantc.org:read:stampede2:/home/bud

        Users granted the role have read permission on the following file system resources on stampede2:

            /home/bud
            /home/bud/
            /home/bud/myfile
            /home/bud/mydir/myfile

        Those users, however, will not have access to /home.

        When an extended permission part ends with a slash, such as /home/bud/, then that part is interpreted as a directory or, more generally, some type of container.  In such cases, the permission applies to the children of the path and to the path as written with a slash.  For instance, for the file permission path /home/bud/, the permission allows access to /home/bud/ and /home/bud/myfile, but not to /home/bud.

        When an extended permission part does not end with a slash, such as /home/bud, then the permission applies to the children of the path and to the path written with or without a trailing slash.  For instance, for the file permission path /home/bud, the permission allows access to /home/bud, /home/bud/ and /home/bud/myfile.

        In the previous examples, we assumed /home/bud was a directory.  If /home/bud is a file (or more generally a leaf), then specifying the permission path /home/bud/ will not work as intended.  Permissions with paths that have trailing slashes should only be used for directories, and they require a trailing slash whenever refering to the root directory.  Permissions that don't have a trailing slash can represent directories or files, and thus are more general.

        Extended permission checking avoids *false capture*.  Whether a path has a trailing slash or not, permission checking will not capture similarly named sibling paths. For example, using the file permission path /home/bud, grantees are allowed access to /home/bud and all its children (if it's a directory), but not to the file /home/buddy.txt nor the directory /home/bud2.

        This request is authorized only if the authenticated user is either the role owner or an administrator.

        This endpoint can be used to get an accounting of existing system/path combinations that match the input specification. Such information is useful when trying to duplicate a set of permissions. For example, one may want to copy a file subtree to another location and assign the same permissions to the new subtree as currently exist on the original subtree. One could use  this call to calculate the users that should be granted permission on the new subtree.

        The optional parameters are roleName, oldPrefix and newPrefix. No wildcards are defined for the path prefix parameters.  When roleName is specified then only permissions assigned to that role are considered.

        When the oldPrefix parameter is provided, it's used to filter out permissions whose paths do not begin with the specified string; when not provided, no path prefix filtering occurs.

        When the newPrefix parameter is not provided no new characters are prepended to the new path, effectively just removing the oldPrefix from the new path. When neither oldPrefix nor newPrefix are provided, no path transformation occurs, though system IDs can still be transformed.

        The result object contains an array of transformation objects, each of which contains the unique permission sequence number, the existing permission that matched the search criteria and the new permission if the specified transformations were applied.

        A valid tenant and user must be specified in the request body.  This request is authorized if the requestor is a user that has access to the specified tenant or if the requestor is a service.

        Remove an extended permission from all roles in a tenant using a request body.  The tenant and permission must be specified in the request body.

        Each role in the tenant is searched for the extended permission string and, where found, that permission is removed.  The matching algorithm is string comparison with wildcard semantics on the path component.  This is the same as an exact string match for all parts of the permission specification up to the path part.  A match on the path part, however, occurs when its path is a prefix of a role permission's path.  Consider the following permission specification:

            files:mytenant:read:mysystem:/my/dir

        which will match both of the following role permissions:

            files:mytenant:read:mysystem:/my/dir/subdir/myfile
            files:mytenant:read:mysystem:/my/dir33/yourfile

        Note that a match to the second role permission might be a *false capture* if the intension was to remove all permissions to resources in the /my/dir subtree, but not those in other directories.  To avoid this potential problem, callers can make two calls, one to this endpoint with a permSpec that ends with a slash ("/") and one to the removePermissionFromeAllRoles endpoint with no trailing slash.  The former removes all children from the directory subtree, the latter removes the directory itself.

        Only the Files service is authorized to make this call.

        Replace the text in a permission specification when its last component defines an *extended path attribute*.  Extended path attributes enhance the standard Shiro matching algorithm with one that treats designated components in a permission specification as a path name, such as a posix file or directory path name.  This request is useful when files or directories have been renamed or moved and their authorizations need to be adjusted.  Consider, for example, permissions that conform to the following specification:

              files:tenantId:op:systemId:path

        By definition, the last component is an extended path attribute whose content can be changed by replacePathPrefix requests.  Specifically, paths that begin with the oldPrefix will have that prefix replaced with the newPrefix value.  Replacement only occurs on permissions that also match the schema and oldSystemId parameter values.  The systemId attribute is required to immediately precede the path attribute, which must be the last attribute.

        Additionally, the oldSystemId is replaced with the newSystemId when a match is found.  If a roleName is provided, then replacement is limited to permissions defined only in that role.  Otherwise, permissions in all roles that meet the other matching criteria will be considered.

        The optional parameters are roleName, oldPrefix and newPrefix. No wildcards are defined for the path prefix parameters.  When roleName is specified then only permissions assigned to that role are considered.

        When the oldPrefix parameter is provided, it's used to filter out permissions whose paths do not begin with the specified string; when not provided, no path prefix filtering occurs.

        When the newPrefix parameter is not provided no new characters are prepended to the new path, effectively just removing the oldPrefix from the new path. When neither oldPrefix nor newPrefix are provided, no path transformation occurs, though system IDs can still be transformed.

        The previewPathPrefix request provides a way to do a dry run using the same input as this request. The preview call calculates the permissions that would change and what their new values would be, but it does not actually change those permissions as replacePathPrefix does.

        The input parameters are passed in the payload of this request.  The response indicates the number of changed permission specifications.

        The path prefix replacement operation is authorized if the user@tenant in the JWT represents a tenant administrator or the Files service.

        Update an existing role's owner using a request body. Required parameters in the payload are the *roleTenant*, which is the tenant of named role, and *newOwner*, which is the user to which role ownership is being transferred. The *newTenant* payload parameter is optional and only needed when the new owner resides in a different tenant than that of the current owner.

        This request is authorized if the requestor is the role owner or an administrator. If a new tenant is specified, then the requestor must also be allowed to act in the new tenant.

        Get a filtered list of shared resources. Query parameters are used to restrict the returned shares. The *grantor*, *grantee*, *tenant*, *resourceType*, *resourceId1*, *resourceId2*, *privilege*, *createdBy* and *createdByTenant* parameters are used to match values in shared resource objects. Other query parameters are used to control how matching is performed.  The *tenant* parameter is required.

        If resourceId1 or resourceId2 end with a percent sign (%) wildcard then the search results will include all shares with IDs that begin with the same prefix string.  Percent signs embedded elsewhere in the string are *not* recognized as wildcards.

        Specifying the *id* parameter causes the other filtering parameters to be ignored. The result list will contain at most one entry.

        The *includePublicGrantees* flag, true by default, controls whether resources granted to **~public** and **~public_no_authn** are also considered for inclusion in the result list.

        The *requireNullId2* flag, true by default, applies only when no *resourceId2* value is provided. When set, only shared resources that do not specify a *resourceId2* value are considered for inclusion in the result list. By setting this flag to false the caller indicates a "don't care" designation on the *resourceId2* value, allowing shares with any *resourceId2* value to be considered for inclusion in the result list.

        For the request to be authorized, the requestor must be a Tapis service.

        Share a Tapis resource using a request body.  Shared resources allow services to indicate that other services should relax their Tapis authorization checking in certain, well-defined contexts.

        Grantees can be given shared access to a resource on an individual basis or by using the public granting mechanism. Grants to the distinguished **~public** and **~public_no_authn** pseudo-grantees allow access to a resource to authenticated users or to any user, respectively.

        The payload for this request includes these values, with all except *resourceId2* required:

           - grantor
           - grantee
           - tenant
           - resourceType

           - privilege

        If the share already exists, then this call has no effect. For the request to be authorized, the requestor must be a Tapis service.

        Determine if a user has been granted a specific privilege on a specific resource. The *grantee*, *tenant*, *resourceType*, *resourceId1* and *privilege* parameters are mandatory; *resourceId2* is optional and assumed to be NULL if not provided. Privilege matching is performed for the grantee and tenant specified in the query parameters.

        True is returned if the user has been granted the privilege, false otherwise.

        By default, both authenticated and unauthenticated public privileges are included in the calculation. For example, if a privilege on a resource has been granted to all authenticated users in a tenant (~public), then true will be returned for all users in the tenant.

        The *excludePublic* and *excludePublicNoAuthn* parameters can be used to change the default handling of public grants. Either or both types of public grants can be excluded.

        For the request to be authorized, the requestor must be a Tapis service.

        Get the permissions assigned to a user in a tenant, including those assigned transively.  The result list can be optionally filtered by the one or both of the query parameters: implies and impliedBy.

        When implies is set, the filter _implies_ each entry in the result set. When impliedBy is set, each entry in the result set is _implied by_ the filter. Below are some examples.

        Consider a user that is assigned these permissions:

            stream:dev:read:project1
            stream:dev:read,write:project1
            stream:dev:read,write,exec:project1

        **Using the *implies* Query Parameter**

        When _implies=stream:dev:*:project1_, this endpoint returns:

            stream:dev:read:project1
            stream:dev:read,write:project1
            stream:dev:read,write,exec:project1

        When _implies=stream:dev:write:project1_, this endpoint returns an empty list.

        **Using the *impliedBy* Query Parameter**

        When _impliedBy=stream:dev:*:project1_, this endpoint returns an empty list.

        When _impliedBy=stream:dev:write:project1_, this endpoint returns:

            stream:dev:read,write:project1
            stream:dev:read,write,exec:project1

        This request is authorized if the requestor is a user that has access to the specified tenant or if the requestor is a service.

        Get all users in a tenant assigned a permission.  The permSpec parameter is a permission specification that uses colons as separators, the asterisk as a wildcard character and commas to define lists.  Here are examples of permission specifications:

            system:mytenant:read:mysystem
            system:mytenant:*:mysystem
            system:mytenant
            files:mytenant:read,write:mysystems
        This method recognizes the percent sign (%) as a string wildcard only in the context of database searching.  If a percent sign (%) appears in the permSpec it is interpreted as a zero or more character wildcard.  For example, the following specification would match the first three of the above example specifications but not the fourth:

            system:mytenant:%

        The wildcard character cannot appear as the first character in the permSpec.

        This request is authorized if the requestor is a user that has access to the specified tenant or if the requestor is a service.

        Soft delete one or more versions of a secret. Each version can be deleted individually or as part of a group specified in the input array. Deletion can be reversed using the *secret/undelete/{secretName}* endpoint, which make this a _soft_ deletion operation.

        The input versions array is interpreted as follows:

           * [-] - empty = delete all versions
           * [0] - zero = delete only the latest version
           * [1, 3, ...] - list = delete the specified versions

        A valid tenant and user must also be specified in the body.

        ### Naming Secrets
        Secrets can be arranged hierarchically by using the "+" characters in the *secretName*.  These characters will be converted to slashes upon receipt, allowing secrets to be arranged in folders.

        A secret is assigned a path name constructed from the *secretType* and *secretName* path parameters and, optionally, from query parameters determined by the *secretType*. Each *secretType* determines a specific transformation from the url path to a path in the vault.  The *secretType* may require certain query parameters to be present on the request in order to construct the vault path.  See the next section for details.

        ### Secret Types
        The list below documents each *secretType* and their applicable query parameters. Highlighted parameter names indicate required parameters. When present, default values are listed first and also highlighted.

          - **system**
            - *sysid*: the unique system id
            - *sysuser*: the accessing user (except when keytype=cert)
            - keytype: *sshkey* | password | accesskey | cert
          - **dbcred**
            - *dbhost*:  the DBMS hostname, IP address or alias
            - *dbname*:  the database name or alias
            - *dbservice*: service name
          - **jwtsigning** - *no query parameters*
          - **user** - *no query parameters*
          - **service** - *no query parameters*

        ### Authorization

        List the secret names at the specified path. The path must represent a folder, not an actual secret name. If the path does not have a trailing slash one will be inserted. Secret names should not encode private information.

        A valid tenant and user must be specified as query parameters.

        ### Naming Secrets
        Secrets can be arranged hierarchically by using the "+" characters in the secret name.  These characters will be converted to slashes upon receipt, allowing secrets to be arranged in folders.

        A secret is assigned a path name constructed from the *secretType* path parameter and, optionally, from query parameters determined by the *secretType*. Each *secretType* determines a specific transformation from the url path to a path in the vault.  The *secretType* may require certain query parameters to be present on the request in order to construct the vault path.  See the next section for details.

        ### Secret Types
        The list below documents each *secretType* and their applicable query parameters. Highlighted parameter names indicate required parameters. When present, default values are listed first and also highlighted.

          - **system**
            - *sysid*: the unique system id
            - *sysuser*: the accessing user (except when keytype=cert)
            - keytype: *sshkey* | password | accesskey | cert

        Create or update a secret. The JSON payload contains a required *data* object and an optional *options* object.  It also contains the required tenant and user fields.

        The *data* object is a JSON object that contains one or more key/value pairs in which both the key and value are strings. These are the individual secrets that are saved under the path name. The secrets are automatically versioned, which allows a pre-configured number of past secret values to be accessible even after new values are assigned. See the various GET operations for details on how to access different aspects of secrets.

        NOTE: The *cas* option is currently ignored but documented here for future reference.

        The *options* object can contain a *cas* key and with an integer value that represents a secret version.  CAS stands for check-and-set and will check an existing secret's version before updating.  If cas is not set the write will be always be allowed. If set to 0, a write will only be allowed if the key doesn’t exist. If the index is greater than zero, then the write will only be allowed if the key’s current version matches the version specified in the cas parameter.

        ### Naming Secrets
        Secrets can be arranged hierarchically by using the "+" characters in the *secretName*.  These characters will be converted to slashes upon receipt, allowing secrets to be arranged in folders.

        A secret is assigned a path name constructed from the *secretType* and *secretName* path parameters and, optionally, from query parameters determined by the *secretType*. Each *secretType* determines a specific transformation from the url path to a path in the vault.  The *secretType* may require certain query parameters to be present on the request in order to construct the vault path.  See the next section for details.

        ### Secret Types
        The list below documents each *secretType* and their applicable query parameters. Highlighted parameter names indicate required parameters. When present, default values are listed first and also highlighted.

          - **system**
            - *sysid*: the unique system id
            - *sysuser*: the accessing user (except when keytype=cert)
            - keytype: *sshkey* | password | accesskey | cert
          - **dbcred**
            - *dbhost*:  the DBMS hostname, IP address or alias
            - *dbname*:  the database name or alias
            - *dbservice*: service name
          - **jwtsigning** - *no query parameters*
          - **user** - *no query parameters*
          - **service** - *no query parameters*

        ### Authorization
        Requestors are authorized based on the secret type specified in the URL path.  The following authorizations are enforced:

        - system: limited to the systems service
        - dbcred: any service
        - jwtsigning: limited to the tokens service
        - user: any user
        - service: any service

        ### Generating Secrets
        Passwords and public/private key pairs appropriate for Tapis use can be generated as part of this secret write call.  To direct SK to create a secret, assign the special value `<generate-secret>` to a key.  When SK detects this value, it generates a password or key pair depending on context, and replaces the `<generate-secret>` text with the generated secret.  In the case of a key pair, both the public and private keys are saved.

        Key pairs are always generated for secrets of type JWTSigning, while passwords are generated for all other secret types unless the key is named *privateKey*.

        To generate a key pair, insert the following key/value pair into the payload's data map:

            key="privateKey", value="<generate-secret>"

        When the key pair is generated, the above key/value item is replaced by these two key/value pairs:

            key="privateKey", value=<private key in pem format>
            key="publicKey",  value=<public key in pem format>

        In non-JWTSigning secret types, passwords are generated whenever the following key/value pair is encountered in the payload's data map:

            key=<name other than privateKey>, value="<generate-secret>"

        The generated password simply replaces the item's value and the key name is left unchanged.

      description: |-
        Restore one or more versions of a secret that have previously been deleted. This endpoint undoes soft deletions performed using the *secret/delete/{secretType}/{secretName}* endpoint.

        The input versions array is interpreted as follows:

           * [-] - empty = undelete all versions
           * [0] - zero = undelete only the latest version
           * [1, 3, ...] - list = undelete the specified versions

        A valid tenant and user must be specified in the body.

        ### Naming Secrets
        Secrets can be arranged hierarchically by using the "+" characters in the *secretName*.  These characters will be converted to slashes upon receipt, allowing secrets to be arranged in folders.

        A secret is assigned a path name constructed from the *secretType* and *secretName* path parameters and, optionally, from query parameters determined by the *secretType*. Each *secretType* determines a specific transformation from the url path to a path in the vault.  The *secretType* may require certain query parameters to be present on the request in order to construct the vault path.  See the next section for details.

        ### Secret Types
        The list below documents each *secretType* and their applicable query parameters. Highlighted parameter names indicate required parameters. When present, default values are listed first and also highlighted.

          - **system**
            - *sysid*: the unique system id
            - *sysuser*: the accessing user (except when keytype=cert)
            - keytype: *sshkey* | password | accesskey | cert
          - **dbcred**
            - *dbhost*:  the DBMS hostname, IP address or alias
            - *dbname*:  the database name or alias
            - *dbservice*: service name
          - **jwtsigning** - *no query parameters*
          - **user** - *no query parameters*
          - **service** - *no query parameters*

        ### Authorization
        Requestors are authorized based on the secret type specified in the URL path.  The following authorizations are enforced:

        - system: limited to the systems service
        - dbcred: any service
        - jwtsigning: limited to the tokens service
        - user: any user

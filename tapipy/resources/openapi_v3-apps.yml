        Update all updatable attributes of an application using a request body identical to POST. Application must exist.

        Note that certain attributes (such as tenant) are allowed but ignored so that the JSON result returned by a GET
        may be modified and used when making a PUT request to update.

        The attributes that are allowed but ignored for both PUT and POST are

          - tenant
          - uuid
          - deleted
          - created
          - updated

        In addition for a PUT operation the following non-updatable attributes are allowed but ignored

          - id
          - version
          - owner
          - enabled

        Note that the attributes owner and enabled may be modified using other endpoints.

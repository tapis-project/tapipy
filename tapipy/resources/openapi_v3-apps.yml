    description: |
      The permissions model allows for fine grained access control of resources. The application owner
      may grant READ and MODIFY permission to specific users. MODIFY implies READ.
  
      Please note that Tapis also supports a higher level approach to granting access known as *Sharing* that also includes
      certain implicit access to resources during the execution of a Tapis job.
  - name: Sharing
    description: |
      In addition to fine grained permissions support, Tapis also supports a higher level approach to granting access.
      This approach is known simply as *sharing*. The sharing API allows an application owner to share an application
      with a set of users as well as share publicly with all users in a tenant. Sharing grants users READ access to the
      application and more importantly allows others to run a job using the application.

      Please note that sharing an application gives a user certain implicit access to resources in the context of running
      a job. For example, if the application has defined a specific execution system id then while the job is running the
      user who has been granted access to the application via sharing will also have the applications owner's
      authorizations when accessing the system and paths on the system. Note that the application owner's authorizations
      supplement the user's authorizations, they do not replace them.

        Note that certain attributes (such as tenant) are allowed but ignored so that the JSON result returned by a GET

          - tenant

          - id
          - version
          - owner
          - enabled

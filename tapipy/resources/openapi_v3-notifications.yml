        For each owner the *name* must be unique and can be composed of alphanumeric characters and the following
        special characters [-._~]. If attribute *name* is not provided then the service will generate one.
        The attributes *typeFilter*, *subjectFilter* and *deliveryTargets* are required.
        
        Subscription attributes:
          - name: Optional short descriptive name. *owner+name* must be unique. If one is not provided the service will create one.
          - description: Optional more verbose description. Maximum length of 2048 characters.
          - owner: A specific user set at create time. Default is *${apiUserId}*.
          - enabled: Indicates if subscription is active. By default enabled is true.
          - typeFilter: Filter to use when matching events. Filter for event type. Has three dot separated parts: *service*, *category* and *detail*. Each field may be a specific type or the wildcard character. Examples are *jobs.job.complete*, *jobs.new_status.\**.
          - subjectFilter: Filter to use when matching events. Filter for subject. This may be a specific subject such as a job Id or the wildcard character *.
          - deliveryTargets: List of delivery targets to be used when delivering a matching event. Must have at least one. Each target includes delivery method (EMAIL or WEBHOOK) and delivery address.
          - ttlMinutes: Time to live in minutes specified when subscription is created or TTL is updated. Service will compute expiry based on TTL. Default is one week from creation. Value of 0 indicates no expiration.

      description: |
        Publish an event to be distributed to all subscribers. Only services may publish events.
        
        The attributes *source*, *type* and *timestamp* are required. Note that certain attributes, marked in
        *italics* in the list below, are allowed but ignored. These attributes are maintained by Tapis. They are
        present when the event is part of a delivered notification.

        Event attributes:
          - source: Context in which event happened: Examples: *Jobs*, *Systems*.
          - type: Type of event. Used for routing notifications. A series of 3 fields separated by the dot character. Pattern is *service.category.detail*. Examples: *jobs.new_status.complete*, *systems.system.create*, *files.object.delete*
          - subject: Subject of event in the context of the service. Examples: job Id, system Id, file path, role name, etc.
          - timestamp: When the event happened.
          - data: Optional additional information associated with the event. Data specific to the service associated with the event.
          - deleteSubscriptionsMatchingSubject: Boolean indicating that all subscriptions whose *subjectFilter* matches the *subject* of the event should be deleted once all notifications are delivered.
          - seriesId: Optional Id that may be used to group events from the same tenant, source and subject. In a series, event order is preserved when sending out notifications.
          - *tenant*: Tapis tenant associated with the event.
          - *uuid*: Tapis generated unique identifier.
          - *user*: Tapis user associated with the event.
        
        Note that events are not persisted by the front end api service. When received they are simply sent to a
        message broker. The back end dispatch service will persist events temporarily in order to support recovery.
        
        An event is delivered to the delivery target in a Notification object. Notification attributes:
          - uuid: Unique identifier for the notification.
          - subscriptionName: Name of subscription associated with the event.

      description: |
        Start a test sequence by creating a subscription and publishing an initial event matching the subscription.
        Only services may perform this operation.
        
        The subscription will have the following properties:
          - owner: *api_user*
          - name: *subscription_uuid*
          - typeFilter: notifications.test.*
          - subjectFilter: *subscription_uuid*
          - deliveryTarget:
            - deliveryMethod: WEBHOOK
            - deliveryAddress: *tenant_base_url*/v3/notifications/test/callback/*subscription_uuid*
          - ttlMinutes: 60

        The default TTL of 1 hour may be overridden using the query parameter *subscriptionTTL*.

        The initial event will have the following properties:
          - source: *tenant_base_url*/v3/notifications/test
          - type: notifications.test.begin
          - subject: *subscription_uuid*
          - seriesId: *subscription_uuid*

        The initial event will be published to the main queue and the subscription will be returned to the caller.
        The sequence of test events may be continued by publishing events that match the test subscription. 
        Results will be recorded when notifications associated with the test are received via the callback.
        The first notification should be recorded shortly after the initial event is published.

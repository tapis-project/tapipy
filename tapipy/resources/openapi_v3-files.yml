      The permissions model allows for fine grained access control of paths on a Tapis system. The system owner
      may grant READ and MODIFY permission to specific users. MODIFY implies READ.
  
      Please note that Tapis also supports a higher level approach to granting access known as *Sharing*.

      Finally, be aware that Tapis permissions are independent of native permissions enforced by the underlying system host.
  - name: Sharing
    description: |
      In addition to fine grained permissions support, Tapis also supports a higher level approach to granting access.
      This approach is known simply as *sharing*. The sharing API allows you to share a path with a set of users
      as well as share publicly with all users in a tenant. Sharing a path grants users READ access to the path.
      
      Please note that the underlying host associated with a system typically also has it's own access controls.

        List files or objects on a Tapis system. Type for items will depend on system type. For example, for LINUX
        they will be posix files and for S3 they will be storage objects. For S3 the recurse flag is ignored and all
        objects with keys matching the path as a prefix are included.
        
        For system types that support directory hierarchies the maximum recursion depth is 20.
        
        Note that S3 buckets do not have a hierarchical structure. There are no directories. Everything is an object
        associated with a key.

        Certain services may use the query parameter *impersonationId* to be used in place of the requesting
        Tapis user. Tapis will use this user Id when performing authorization and resolving the *effectiveUserId*
        for the system.
        
        Certain services may use the query parameter *sharedAppCtx* to indicate that the request is in a shared
        application context. Tapis authorization will be bypassed.

        will be removed.

        Certain services may use the query parameter *impersonationId* to be used in place of the requesting
        Tapis user. Tapis will use this user Id when performing authorization and resolving the *effectiveUserId*
        for the system.
        
        Use the query parameter *zip* to request a stream compressed using the ZIP file format. This is not allowed
        if system *rootDir* plus *path* would result in all files on the host being included. Please download
        individual directories, files or objects.

        application context. Tapis authorization will be bypassed.
